/**
 * Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to
 * provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.
 * <p>
 * <p> The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used.  The
 * default is large enough for most purposes.
 * <p>
 * <p> In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding
 * read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream.  It is
 * therefore advisable to wrap a CustomBufferedReader around any Reader whose read()
 * operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders.  For
 * example,
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * CustomBufferedReader in
 *   = new CustomBufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.in"));
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * will buffer the input from the specified file.  Without buffering, each
 * invocation of read() or readLine() could cause bytes to be read from the
 * file, converted into characters, and then returned, which can be very
 * inefficient.
 * <p>
 * <p> Programs that use DataInputStreams for textual input can be localized by
 * replacing each DataInputStream with an appropriate CustomBufferedReader.
